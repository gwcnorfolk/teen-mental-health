# Mental Health for Teens

This is a Girls Who Code Slover Library project to provide teens with strategies for dealing with mental health issues,
and to provide links to resources for assistance.

The website framework for each page consists of 4 sections of text with 4 background images. Some pages
have embedded <iframe> code that runs apps we created in Code.org
