          Anxiety is often described as always being and or feeling anxious all
          the time, but it isn't a singular concept. For instance, two people
          could say they both have an anxiety disorder. One could have social
          anxiety, and the other could have OCD, which are two
          different sub-groups that the term anxiety disorders contain. To put
          it simply, there are more than just one form of anxiety.

          <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
         Social isolation is most commonly described as a lack of social connections with others.
         The lack of enjoyable social connections a person has can make them feel lonely.
         This is the basic idea of what social isolation is. 
         Although, people can feel lonely without being socially isolated. 
         Social isolation is a complicated mental illness to understand and identify.
